# thesiscode
This repository contains the analysis scripts used to write [my PhD thesis](http://markchil.github.io/pdfs/thesis.pdf), working in the department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT. Refer to the comments at the top of each script for an explanation of what it does and which figure(s) it makes. Most scripts follow a standard pattern of performing the analysis first, writing the results to a pickle file, then loading Matplotlib and producing the plots.

If you use or adapt these codes for academic research, please cite [my PhD thesis](http://markchil.github.io/pdfs/thesis.pdf) using the following BibTeX record:
